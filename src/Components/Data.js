A true queen no misconceptions.'

        content :'People die and that’s okay.Doesn’t take away the life they lived.Doesn’t change the love they gave.Doesn’t clear the memories they made.People die and that’s okay.Today their pain transcends.Today they cry no more.Today they are free.People die and that’s okay.Their stories become treasures.Their smiles remain comfort.Their pictures give hope.People die and that’s okay.Spencer’s gone but not forever.Papi’s passed but not a past.My best friend left but I still feel his warmth. Spencer died and that’s okay.'

        title: 'Broken',
        content : 'Let’s fall in love.Hold my hands and lead the way.I dunno how to go about it.You see I have been broken.Shattered and crushed into many pieces.Let’s fall in love.Tell me you need me.Show me where I fill the void.Explain my importance.Everyone has left me broken.Beaten and battered literally.Let’s fall in love.Expose me to happiness.Unimaginable emotions of pure euphoria.Maybe I can forget I’m broken.Tossed and abused severally.Let’s fall in love.Remind me each day you want me.Entrust your heart in my care.Mend what was once broken.Misused and forgotten without a thought.Let’s fall in love.I’m afraid you can’t handle it.Not getting your love reciprocated.Because I’m broken you see.Insecure and have never felt love.'
